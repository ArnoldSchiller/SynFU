Introduction
=============

So what is SynFU all about?
----------------------------

| SynFU (short for *SynCom Filter Utilities*) is a comprehensive set of easy-to-setup,
| easy-to-use tools for NNTP<-->Mail two way sync.

The development takes part as a component of the so called SynCom_ concept developed by Members of the `Bundes-IT`_, a part of the `BGEpartei Deutschland`_.

At the current state SynFU provides three components:

	- :ref:`synfu-reactor`: a handsome filter for mailing list messages
	- :ref:`synfu-news2mail`: a drop-in replacement for INN_'s news2mail.pl
	- :ref:`synfu-mail2news`: a drop-in replacement for INN_'s mail2news.pl
	- :ref:`synfu-imp`: a plugin based task scheduler for periodic jobs

:ref:`synfu-reactor` started out as a simple filter to remove mailman signatures from messages before passing them to the INN_ import scripts.
Soon more and more features where added resulting in a flexible mail filter with the ability to correct many malformed message headers *as well* as remove mailman and generic mailing list signatures.

:ref:`synfu-news2mail` and :ref:`synfu-mail2news` where created to supersede the original INN_ scripts news2mail and mail2news.
They have the benefit of being more configurable and more flexible than their counterparts.

:ref:`synfu-imp` tries to solve the need for maintenance jobs and background processing need by providing a simple plugin-based framework.
Jobs are written in python, dynamically loaded upon executing imp.

Why should I use it?
